This repository contains the code used to generate the dataset described in the article:
"Dataset of Dual-Pol Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery for Training Despeckling Filters"", under review for IEEE Data Descriptions.


The code in this repository allows the generation of a dataset with 12,600 Sentinel-1 images in VV and VH polarizations, with pairs of noisy images and their ground truth generated through multitemporal fusion. 
The images come from random locations and dates, increasing heterogeneity and improving the generalization of trained models.


The dataset associated with this code is available at: https://doi.org/10.21227/6yfn-2z15
